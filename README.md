# Natural Language Processing Projects

<p> This repo contains two NLP projects.</p>
<ol><li>News article classification</li>
<li>Named Entity Recognition</li></ol>

## 1. News article classification

### Background
<p> The data used in this project comes from the Sharing News Online project which investigates why people share news on social media. (It is not a NLP/machine learning related research, but if you're interested in political economics or journalism, go ahead and check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sharing_News_Online/YQSjDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">book</a>.)
The authors also ask an interesting question: <b>which topics of articles get shared?</b>
The task of classifying news articles into different topics has to be done to perform this type of research.

</p>


### Objectives of this project
<p>Train a statistical text classification system. 
Evaluate the precidtion and analyse errors.
Give insights about how feature extraction approaches may enhance the representation of language for text classification, and validate this through empirical experimentation.</p>
