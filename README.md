## 1. News article classification

### Background
<p> The data used in this project comes from the Sharing News Online project which investigates why people share news on social media. (It is not a NLP/machine learning related research, but if you're interested in political economics or journalism, go ahead and check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sharing_News_Online/YQSjDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">book</a>.) </br>
The authors also ask an interesting question: <b>which topics of articles get shared?</b></br>
The task of classifying news articles into different topics has to be done to perform this type of research.
